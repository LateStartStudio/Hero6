To develop against the file on Windows OS, you'll need to replace your Twine Stories folder with a Symbolic Directory Link to the git repository.

For example:

```
mklink /D "C:\Users\{User Name}\Documents\Twine\Stories" "C:\{Path to repository}\assets\Story Board"
```
The link should live at ```C:\Users\{User Name}\Documents\Twine\```
